# ISO-27001-2022-C6 — ISMS Planning (Risk & Objectives)

**Owner:** 3B Credit Builder (3Boost Club)  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Status:** Approved  
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-17  

---## Risk Approach
We identify, assess, treat, and monitor information security risks across Analyzer, Vault, dashboards, and supporting infrastructure.

## Security Objectives (Measurable)
- 0 confirmed cross-tenant access incidents (threeb_id isolation)
- 100% private buckets + signed URLs; no public objects
- 100% of Vault actions recorded (vault_events) and system-wide events recorded (system_events)
- KPI refresh success rate >= 99% monthly
- RLS policy test suite passes on every release
