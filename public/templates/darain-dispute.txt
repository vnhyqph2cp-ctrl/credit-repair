Re: Notice of Dispute – Failure to Ensure Accurate Reporting

To Whom It May Concern,

I am disputing the continued reporting of the account listed below, which remains inaccurate and/or unverifiable.

Account Name: [Creditor Name]
Account Number: [Partial or Last 4 Digits]

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. §1681), consumer reporting agencies are required to maintain reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy. The continued reporting of this account raises concerns regarding compliance with these obligations.

If you are unable to provide proper verification of this account, including confirmation of accuracy and completeness, I am requesting immediate deletion.

Please provide written confirmation of your investigation results.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
